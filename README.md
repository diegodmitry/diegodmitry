### Hi there 👋
---
I'm Diêgo Dmitry, I'm graduated in Systems Analysis and Development, Post Graduate in Network Security and former military 🪖. However, I'm currently passionate about software development and I'm training myself more and more in order to become a **Full Stak Developer**. The reason for the career change is because the programming makes me overnight stay in a different way 😅. Indeed, I like to program, to think, to plan plans, to solve problems.
If you're wondering whether or not to chat me, don't think, do it, I'm here to teach, learn, exchange experiences, play a game and available for any Happy Hour!😎

### What I like to do?
---
* ⚽ I really enjoy watching and playing football.
* 🏃 One thing I love to do, especially when I have free time, is running. Let's go!!!
* 🎮 I like playing video games and playing on computer as well. My favorite computer game is World of Warcraft, but on the video game I have some favorite gamees, like: PES or FIFA, Gran Turism, The Witcher and Metal Gear Solid. 
* 🌱 Currently I live coding, I'm very focused on learning more and more about the backend.
* When it comes to Front-end I enjoy using React, I like to think about how to do the logic, reuse components and keep the code organized.
