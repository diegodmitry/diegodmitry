### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
---
I'm DiÃªgo Dmitry, I'm graduated in Systems Analysis and Development, Post Graduate in Network Security and former military ðŸª–. However, I'm currently passionate about software development and I'm training myself more and more in order to become a **Full Stak Developer**. The reason for the career change is because the programming makes me overnight stay in a different way ðŸ˜…. Indeed, I like to program, to think, to plan plans, to solve problems.
If you're wondering whether or not to chat me, don't think, do it, I'm here to teach, learn, exchange experiences, play a game and available for any Happy Hour!ðŸ˜Ž

### What I like to do?
