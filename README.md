### Hi there 👋

I'm Diego Dmitry, a graduate in Systems Analysis and Development with a postgraduate degree in Network Security, and a former military professional. 🪖. Over the years, I have transitioned into a multifaceted IT specialist, passionate not only about software development but also about improving IT infrastructures, database administrator, and systems security. My military background has instilled a disciplined work ethic and strategic thinking, which I apply across various sectors including IT administration, software development, and technical support.

Currently, my focus is on leveraging my comprehensive IT skills to enhance system operability and performance, tailoring my approach to meet the dynamic needs of modern technology landscapes. I'm enthusiastic about problem-solving, strategic planning, and mentoring peers in the tech community.

Whether it's discussing technology, playing a strategic game, or unwinding at a happy hour, I'm always open to learning, sharing experiences, and connecting with like-minded professionals. This is the reason why I like the IT career, it makes me spend the night in a different way 😅.

If you're wondering whether or not to chat me, don't think, do it, I'm here to teach, learn, exchange experiences, play a game and available for any Happy Hour! 😎
